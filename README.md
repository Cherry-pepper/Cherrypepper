CherryPepper translation team

At CherryPepper, we believe that beautiful stories should be shared — across borders, languages, and cultures.

Our small team of Ukrainian expats works to translate popular and meaningful novels from Japanese, Chinese, and English into Ukrainian, so that more people can enjoy them in our native language. At the same time, we also want the world to hear Ukrainian voices — that’s why we translate select Ukrainian works into English, helping them reach a broader, international audience.

We’re not a business. We’re a group of readers, fans, and language lovers doing what we enjoy: translating the stories we love — mostly m/m romance and BL (Boys’ Love). These are romantic stories between men, written with heart, depth, and feeling. We translate them because they move us, and we know they’ll move others too.

Thank you for reading in Ukrainian with us. And thank you for reading Ukrainian.
